# MEMDM
This is a memory based neural network model for dialog management.

After clone the code, you have to make the following manually:

```
MEMDM_code<br>
|-test<br>
  |-1<br>
  |-2<br>
  |-3<br>
  |-4<br>
  |-5<br>
|-save<br>
  |-1<br>
  |-2<br>
  |-3<br>
  |-4<br>
  |-5<br>
  |-log<br>
|-summary<br>
|-attn_log
```

The pretrained word embeddings are placed in ```word_embeddings```. If you want to use different word embedding size, you can put your embedding file into it with the same file name format.
