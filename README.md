# MEMDM
This is a memory based neural network model for dialog management.

After clone the code, you have to make the following manually:

```
MEMDM_code
|-test
  |-1
  |-2
  |-3
  |-4
  |-5
|-save
  |-1
  |-2
  |-3
  |-4
  |-5
  |-log
|-summary
|-attn_log
```

The pretrained word embeddings are placed in ```word_embeddings```. If you want to use different word embedding size, you can put your embedding file into it with the same file name format.
